•	Setup Firebase for Data Storage by user

•	A logged-in User can create new Employees.

•	A logged-in User can modify/edit Employees.

•	A logged-in User can View the List of Employees.

•	A logged-in User can delete employees.

•	A logged-in User can Text Message employees.



Libraries used:

•	React Native Flux Router (for navigation)

•	Utilized 'common' components from other projects such as Card and CardSection
